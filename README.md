- ⚡ Fun fact: Scottish game designer Chris Sawyer released Transport Tycoon in 1994, and spent time to consider what to do for a sequel. Some of the revenue he earned from Transport Tycoon he used towards travelling in Europe and the United States, which included visits to theme parks with roller coasters. Though Sawyer said he had hated roller coasters before, he became fond of them through these trips, and since has become a roller coaster enthusiast and had ridden on at least 700 coasters. From these trips, Sawyer decided to follow Transport Tycoon with a roller coaster-based simulation, giving him a partial excuse to continue visiting theme parks to "research" roller coaster rides. The game was to be called White Knuckle for the majority of the game's development. However, to follow the tradition of the Tycoon titles, the game was renamed accordingly.
The game was developed in a small village near Dunblane over the course of two years. Sawyer wrote 99% of the code for RollerCoaster Tycoon in x86 assembly language for the Microsoft Macro Assembler, with the remaining one percent written in C. The graphics were designed by artist Simon Foster using several 3D modeling, rendering, and paint programs. Initially, Sawyer used family and friends to help playtest the game, and then turned to Hasbro, the publisher, to help complete more extensive bug-testing and feedback. For his efforts, Sawyer made around $30 million in royalties.
